- Installation

    Run scrips/rabbit-ubuntu-setup.sh to install Erlang and RabbitMQ.



- Install RabbitMQ Management Plugins

  Install the management plugin.

    $ sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management

  Now, the management dashboard will be started along with rabbit as system startup.
    By default, this is on port 15672.

    # Check that the port is in use
    $ ss -tunelp | grep 15672

    # Navigate to dashboard
    http://localhost:15672

  The default account is:

    u: guest
    p: guest

  To add a new account, so that the dashboard can be accessed over the network:

    $ rabbitmqctl add_user admin strongPassword
    $ rabbitmqctl set_user_tags admin administrator

- Starting RabbitMQ

    The server will run at startup as a non-privileged user 'rabbitmq'.

      # Start the server manually
      $ sudo service rabbitmq-server start

      # Stop the server manually
      $ sudo service rabbitmq-server stop

      # Check the status of the server
      $ sudo service rabbitmq-server status
